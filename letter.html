    <h2>Dear Ms. Carla Pilar.</h2>
    <p>I know you're wondering why I'm making you a website. Well, I want to make a website for you that has pictures of when we spent time together. But, yes, there are still many images that I did not include on this website due to time constraints. I only started this website five days before our anniversary, and I still have a busy schedule, which is why it's hard for me to do it properly.</p>
        
    <p>I hope you'll like this one I made for you. I really did everything I could to make this perfect. I'm really suck at designing websites, so bear with me. I did my best to do this so I could see the smile on your face, which is my favorite. So please contact me if there is something you don't like or that offends you. I promise to make it more perfect next time I make another page for you. Always remember that I love you, and I will do everything to see you smile and for you to see your worth.</p>
        
    <p>For memories, feel free to click on the months above this letter. Clicking it will lead you to another page that contains our pictures together for that month.</p>
        
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Mica</p>
